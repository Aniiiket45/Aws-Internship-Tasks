## Task 1: Cloud Storage Setup

### Objective
- Demonstrate creating and configuring AWS S3 storage buckets.
- Upload sample files and manage access permissions.

### Key Steps
- Create an S3 bucket on AWS.
- Upload sample files to the bucket.
- Configure bucket policies/permissions to control access.
- Enable secure file hosting.

### Skills Demonstrated
- S3 bucket management
- Secure permission setup

## Task 2: Cloud Monitoring and Alert

### Objective
- Set up real-time monitoring for cloud applications using AWS CloudWatch.
- Configure metrics, alarms, and dashboards.
- Set up automated notifications for critical issues.

### Key Steps
- Monitor EC2 instance metrics (CPU utilization, etc.).
- Create CloudWatch alarms with threshold triggers.
- Use SNS for email notifications.
- Build and customize CloudWatch dashboards.
- Test monitoring by generating artificial load.

### Skills Demonstrated
- CloudWatch metric/alarm management
- Custom dashboards
- Automated email/SNS alerting

## Task 3: Cloud Security Implementation

### Objective
- Implement best-practice security using AWS IAM, S3, and encryption features.

### Key Steps
- Create IAM users/roles with least privilege; enable MFA.
- Set S3 buckets to private, configure policies and AWS-managed access permissions.
- Enable SSE-S3 encryption for data at rest.
- Ensure HTTPS is used for secure data transmission.

### Skills Demonstrated
- AWS IAM user and policy management
- S3 security controls and encryption

## Installation
